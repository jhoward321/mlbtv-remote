# MLBtv Remote

This is a custom API front end for the popular [mlbviewer project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mlbviewer/). This project is still a work in progress and this README will be updated as I add more functionality. Currently the API will provide MLB game schedules for different dates and teams. It will start specified games (MLB.tv account required). I still am adding features and cleaning up bugs, and the code will be cleaned up as I finish features. Future plans include a remote command line interface to start mlbviewer on a separate machine. This project was meant to allow me to watch MLBtv on my raspberry pi without having to manually select the game on the device. I may implement different front ends for the API as I get further along.
